# Decision Record: User Model & Reasoning Choice

## Decision: User Control Over Model and Reasoning Selection

**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Approved  
**Stakeholders**: Development team, Users

### Context
Roadmap initially appeared to prescribe specific Claude models and reasoning modes for each feature. This could create barriers for users with limited API access or different preferences.

### Problem
- Some users may only have access to Haiku due to cost constraints
- Users should have autonomy over their Claude experience
- Features shouldn't be gatekept by specific model requirements
- Roadmap recommendations could be misinterpreted as requirements

### Decision
**All features MUST work with any available Claude model and reasoning mode**, with roadmap entries serving as **recommendations only** for optimal performance.

### Implementation Requirements

#### **Universal Model Support**
- âœ… **Haiku**: All features must function with Haiku
- âœ… **Sonnet**: All features must function with Sonnet  
- âœ… **Opus**: All features must function with Opus

#### **Universal Reasoning Support**
- âœ… **Think**: All features must work with basic reasoning
- âœ… **Think Deep**: All features must work with deep reasoning
- âœ… **Ultrathink**: All features must work with maximum reasoning

#### **Graceful Adaptation**
Features should:
- Adapt complexity based on chosen model capabilities
- Provide appropriate results regardless of reasoning depth
- Gracefully handle limitations of less capable models
- Maintain core functionality across all configurations

### Rationale

**Accessibility**: Users with budget constraints or limited API access shouldn't be excluded from any features.

**User Autonomy**: Users know their needs, preferences, and constraints better than we do.

**Inclusive Design**: Features should be accessible to the broadest possible user base.

**Recommendations vs Requirements**: Roadmap recommendations guide optimal usage without creating barriers.

### Examples

#### **CH-1. Natural Language Automation Builder**
- **Recommended**: Sonnet + Think Deep (optimal complexity handling)
- **Required**: Works with Haiku + Think (simpler automations, still functional)
- **Enhanced**: Opus + Ultrathink (handles most complex edge cases)

#### **CW-1. Background Monitoring**  
- **Recommended**: Haiku + Think (cost-effective 24/7 operation)
- **Alternative**: Sonnet + Think Deep (more sophisticated analysis)
- **Premium**: Opus + Ultrathink (maximum intelligence, higher cost)

### Updated Roadmap Language
- Changed "Model:" to "Model (Recommended):"
- Changed "Reasoning:" to "Reasoning (Recommended):"
- Added implementation requirements for universal compatibility
- Clarified recommendations vs requirements throughout

### Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Update all feature implementations to support any model
- [ ] Test features across all model/reasoning combinations
- [ ] Document feature behavior differences across configurations
- [ ] Ensure UI clearly shows model/reasoning as user choice
- [ ] Create fallback strategies for less capable model combinations

### Success Criteria
- All Phase 1 features work acceptably with Haiku + Think
- Users can freely choose their preferred model/reasoning combination
- Feature quality scales appropriately with model capability
- No features are gated behind specific model requirements
