# Development Notes

## Future Considerations

### MCP Server Integration
Consider integrating with Home Assistant's MCP Server integration:
https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mcp_server/

This could potentially allow Claude Home to:
- Act as an MCP server for Home Assistant
- Provide Claude's capabilities directly to HA automations
- Enable two-way communication between Claude and HA

**Note**: Don't get derailed by this now - focus on getting v2.0.0 working first.
Research and plan this for a future v3.0 enhancement.
