## Current Status

- Waiting for Terminal 3's model bug analysis

## Ready for Integration
1. Core scripts that solve env -S issue
2. Dual-mode architecture implemented
3. HA adapter ready to use ghcr.io image

## Next Steps
- Integrate Terminal 3's bug fixes when ready
- Help Terminal 2 with Docker setup if needed

## Notes for Other Terminals
- Use `/opt/claude-home/core/claude-wrapper.sh` instead of direct `claude` command
- The wrapper solves ALL BusyBox issues
- Environment detection handles both HA and standalone modes
