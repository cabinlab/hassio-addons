# Revised Model Assignments - Speed Optimized

## Speed Considerations
- **Haiku**: ~2-3x faster response time than Opus
- **Sonnet**: ~1.5x faster than Opus
- **Opus**: Most capable but slowest

## Optimal Assignment for Speed + Capability

### Terminal 2 - Container Infrastructure
**Model: Haiku** âœ…

**Why Haiku is perfect here:**
- Dockerfile creation is template work - Haiku excels
- Registry research is documentation reading - simple
- Build scripts are standard patterns
- **Speed benefit**: Will finish container work while others still working
- Can iterate quickly on build issues

### Terminal 3 - Bug Fixes & Features
**Model: Opus** ðŸ§ 

**Why Opus is needed here:**
- Model selection bug is subtle - involves environment variables, config files, and runtime behavior
- Auth detection has been persistently tricky - needs deep analysis
- Terminal UI color codes require careful escape sequence handling
- These bugs stumped previous attempts

**Speed impact**: Slower, but these are the hardest problems that failed before

### Main Terminal (This one) - Orchestration
**Model: Opus** ðŸŽ¯

**Already on Opus for:**
- Architecture decisions
- Parallel coordination
- Integration complexity

## Why This Distribution Works

1. **Haiku on Terminal 2** finishes fast:
   - Gets container built/tested quickly
   - Frees up to help others if needed
   - Simple tasks don't need Opus

2. **Opus on Terminal 3** tackles the hard stuff:
   - These bugs have persisted through multiple attempts
   - Need maximum debugging capability
   - Worth the speed tradeoff

3. **Total time**: Still ~1-1.5 hours
   - Haiku terminal finishes in 30-45 min
   - Opus terminals take 60-90 min
   - But they're working in parallel

## Alternative if Speed is Critical

Swap Terminal 3 to **Sonnet**:
- Faster than Opus
- Probably capable enough for bugs
- Risk: Might miss subtle issues
- Benefit: 30% faster completion

Your call: **Maximum success** (2x Opus + Haiku) or **Faster completion** (2x Opus + Haiku as proposed, or Opus + Sonnet + Haiku)?
