# Quick Start for Configuration Analysis Task

## Your Mission
Analyze and redesign the Claude Home addon configuration system to be more intelligent, user-friendly, and token-efficient.

## First Steps
1. Read `CONFIG_ANALYSIS_TASK.md` for full details
2. Review `CURRENT_STATE.md` to understand what exists
3. Study `EXAMPLES_AND_PRIORITIES.md` for context

## Key Focus Areas
- How can we make context selection smarter than "just grab 100 entities"?
- How should configuration fields interact and enable/disable each other?
- What Home Assistant native APIs can we leverage?
- How do we optimize token usage across different models?

## Remember
- You're using Opus model - take time for deep analysis
- Favor HA-native solutions over custom implementations  
- Document limitations and ask questions in QUESTIONS.md
- Think about both new and power users

## Output Location
All your analysis files go in this directory (/home/andrew/hassio-addons/dev-workspace/memory/)

Good luck!
