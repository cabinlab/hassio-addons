# Integration Status Update

## Model Bug: FIXED ✅
The main addon has been updated with the fix:
- Settings.json created at `~/.claude/settings.json` 
- Model passed explicitly with `--model` parameter
- Environment variable properly set
- **60x cost issue resolved!**

## Terminal Progress Summary

### Terminal 2 (Haiku) - COMPLETE ✅

- No BusyBox issues
- Ready for registry push

### Terminal 3 (Opus) - SUCCESS ✅
- Found model bug root cause via documentation
- Solution already integrated
- Continuing with auth improvements

### Main Terminal - READY ✅
- Architecture complete
- Integration scripts ready
- Documentation strategy defined

## Next Steps

### 1. Container Registry Setup
Now that the critical bug is fixed, we can proceed with:
```bash
# Login to GitHub Container Registry
echo "PAT_TOKEN" | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin

# Push the clean container
cd /home/andrew/hassio-addons/dev-workspace/standalone
docker buildx build \
    --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
    -t ghcr.io/cabinlab/claude-home:2.0.0 \
    --push .
```

### 2. Update Add-on to Use Clean Container
Once pushed, update build.yaml to reference the new image.

### 3. Version 2.0.0 Release
- Clean container (no BusyBox issues)
- Model selection fixed
- Dual-mode architecture
- Documentation-first approach

## Lessons Learned
- Always check official documentation first
- Test assumptions against documented behavior
- Small fixes can have huge impacts (60x cost savings!)

## Documentation-First Success
This troubleshooting session proves the value of consulting official documentation. Terminal 3 found in minutes what could have taken hours of trial and error.
