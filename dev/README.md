# Development Workspace

This directory serves as our development collaboration workspace and scratchpad for add-on development across the repository.

**IMPORTANT:** When working in this shared workspace, always specify which add-on you're referencing since this workspace is shared across multiple add-ons (claude-home, apcupsd, etc.).

## Purpose

- **Feature Planning**: Document proposed features and implementation strategies
- **Decision Tracking**: Record approval/rejection decisions with rationale
- **Research Notes**: Store findings from Claude Code documentation and HA integration patterns
- **Prototyping**: Test implementations and proof-of-concepts
- **Collaboration**: Share ideas and iterate on designs

## Structure

- `feature-roadmap.md` - Comprehensive feature roadmap with priorities
- `decisions/` - Decision records for major features
- `prototypes/` - Experimental code and proof-of-concepts
- `research/` - Technical research and findings
- `meeting-notes/` - Development discussions and decisions

## Note

This directory is excluded from git via `.gitignore` to allow for messy experimentation and private notes.
