# Claude Code Capabilities Research

*Research Date: 2025-01-06*

## Summary

Comprehensive research into Claude Code's official capabilities to inform Claude Home feature development.

## Key Findings

### 1. Best Practices (anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)

**Workflow Flexibility**:
- Claude Code doesn't impose specific workflows
- Supports multiple approaches: explore/plan/code/commit, TDD, visual iteration
- Flexible automation patterns

**Integration Capabilities**:
- Bash environment access
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connections
- Custom slash commands  
- GitHub CLI integration

**Development Patterns**:
- Context files (CLAUDE.md) for guidance
- Subagents for complex problem-solving
- Iterative development with review stages
- Implementation plan generation and verification

### 2. Settings & Configuration (docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings)

**Configuration Hierarchy**:
- Hierarchical settings via settings.json
- User, project, and enterprise-level configs
- Environment variable management

**Model Management**:
- Flexible model selection via ANTHROPIC_MODEL
- Different models for main/background tasks
- Custom authentication and headers

**UI & Permissions**:
- Light/dark themes with customization
- Granular permission controls
- Proxy configuration support
- Fine-grained access rules

### 3. SDK Capabilities (docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk)

**Programmatic Control**:
- Non-interactive mode via CLI
- AI as subprocess capability
- Multi-turn conversations with session resumption

**Automation Features**:
- Custom system prompts
- Output format control (text, JSON, streaming)
- Tool allowance/restriction mechanisms

**Architecture**:
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for external tools
- Configurable permission handling
- JSON response streaming

### 4. CLI Usage (docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-usage)

**Command Modes**:
- Interactive and one-shot modes
- Print mode for scripting
- Piped content processing
- Configurable output formats

**Session Management**:
- Session ID tracking and resumption
- Conversation history control
- Model context protocol integration
- Account switching

**Advanced Features**:
- Multiline command support
- Vim-style editing mode
- Quick memory with "#" prefix
- Slash commands for system management

## Strategic Implications for Claude Home

### 1. Natural Language First
Users prefer describing intent over writing YAML - aligns with automation builder concept.

### 2. Extensible Architecture  
MCP integration enables community-driven tool ecosystem for Home Assistant.

### 3. Security by Design
Permission system provides granular control over automation capabilities.

### 4. Session-Based Workflows
Support for complex, multi-step automation development projects.

### 5. Non-Interactive Automation
Background processing capabilities for proactive monitoring (Watchdog).

## Feature Alignment
