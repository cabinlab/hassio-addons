# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.19] - 2025-01-08

### ðŸ”§ PERMISSIONS FIX: Device Access Rights
- **Device Permissions Fix**: Automatically fix hiddev device permissions before daemon startup
- **Root Cause Resolution**: Address device permission issues that prevent daemon communication
- **Comprehensive Fix**: Fix permissions for both specific devices and all hiddev devices
- **Enhanced Logging**: Show device permissions before and after fix attempts
- **Targeted Solution**: Based on analysis showing consistent permission issues in logs

### Technical Details
- Change device permissions from 600 (crw-------) to 666 (crw-rw-rw-)
- Ensure proper ownership (root:root) for all hiddev devices
- Fix permissions for specific DEVICE setting and all /dev/usb/hiddev* devices
- This addresses the consistent "Device permissions issue" warnings in logs

**This should resolve the core permissions barrier preventing daemon UPS communication!**

## [2.0.18] - 2025-01-08

### ðŸ”§ TARGETED FIX: apctest vs Daemon Device Discovery Gap
- **Bridge apctest/daemon gap**: When apctest succeeds with blank device but daemon fails
- **Device Discovery**: Extract actual device path that apctest uses successfully  
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use apctest success to configure daemon with specific device
- **Verbose Device Detection**: Enhanced logging to show which device apctest discovers
- **Fallback Logic**: Default to /dev/usb/hiddev0 if device extraction fails

### Problem Analysis
- apctest consistently works with blank device configuration
- apcupsd daemon fails with same blank device configuration  
- Root cause: Different device access methods between apctest and daemon
- Solution: Use apctest to discover working device, then configure daemon specifically

This addresses the specific scenario where auto-detection works for testing but not for the running daemon.

## [2.0.17] - 2025-01-08

### ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIX: USB Device Configuration
- **Blank Device Setting**: Implement apcupsd best practice of leaving DEVICE blank for USB connections
- **Auto-Detection Priority**: For USB and apcsmart+USB, try blank device first before specific paths  
- **Follows Documentation**: Aligns with official apcupsd guidance that USB devices should auto-detect
- **Permissions Fix**: Resolves device permission issues by letting apcupsd handle USB detection
- **Research-Based Solution**: Implements fix discovered from apcupsd community troubleshooting

### Technical Changes
- USB type: Always use blank DEVICE setting for auto-detection
- apcsmart+USB: Try blank device first, fallback to specific paths if needed
- Improved logging to show when using auto-detection vs specific device paths
- Based on extensive research showing COMMLOST issues caused by explicit device paths

**This should resolve the persistent COMMLOST communication issues!**

## [2.0.16] - 2025-01-08

## [2.0.14] - 2025-01-08

### Enhanced

- **Smart Device Selection**: For apcsmart protocol, test device compatibility using apctest before daemon startup
- **Improved Fallback Logic**: Better device preference handling with accessibility testing
- **Enhanced Debugging**: More detailed logging for device selection and compatibility testing
- **Reduced COMMLOST Issues**: Proactive device testing reduces communication failures

### Technical Improvements
