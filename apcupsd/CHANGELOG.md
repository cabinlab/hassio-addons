## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-08

### üé® MAJOR UX IMPROVEMENT: Simplified Connection Configuration
- **Single Connection Type Dropdown**: Replace confusing separate Cable/Protocol dropdowns with unified selection
- **Pre-tested Combinations**: Only show working cable/protocol combinations that are known to function
- **Clear Descriptions**: Each option explains what hardware setup it supports with emoji icons
- **Recommended Default**: Set `smart_usb` as default (the proven working configuration)
- **Eliminates Confusion**: No more guessing which cable+protocol combinations work together

### Available Connection Types
- üîå **Smart Cable + USB Protocol** (RECOMMENDED - proven working)
- üîå **USB Cable + USB Protocol** (Standard consumer UPS)
- üì° **Smart Cable + APC Smart Protocol** (Enterprise/serial UPS)
- üì° **USB Cable + APC Smart Protocol** (Hybrid configuration)
- üîó **Simple Cable + Dumb Protocol** (Basic serial UPS)
- üåê **Ethernet + Network Protocol** (Network UPS)
- üìä **SNMP + SNMP Protocol** (Enterprise SNMP UPS)

## [2.0.20] - 2025-01-08

### üîß CRITICAL FIX: Container Permissions for USB Devices
- **Added `full_access: true`**: Enables proper USB device access in container environment
- **Resolved "Read-only file system" errors**: Fixed the core issue preventing daemon communication
- **Restored original functionality**: Matches the hardware access that made the pre-fork version work

### Root Cause & Solution
The modernized add-on had restrictive container security that prevented USB device write access. After extensive troubleshooting including device auto-detection, permissions fixes, and protocol testing, the issue was identified as missing container privileges. Adding `full_access: true` restored the hardware access needed for USB UPS communication.

### What We Learned
- **Strategies that didn't work**: Device path auto-detection, permission changes, protocol switching
- **Root cause**: Container filesystem restrictions preventing daemon USB access  
- **Solution**: Container-level privilege escalation (`full_access: true`)
- **Key insight**: apctest worked (read-only) but daemon failed (needed write access)

## [2.0.6] - 2025-01-07

### Added Auto-Discovery Integration
- **Automatic Home Assistant Integration**: Sets up native APC UPS Daemon integration automatically
- **Dynamic Hostname Detection**: Discovers correct add-on hostname with repository hash
- **Seamless Setup**: No manual integration configuration required
- **UPS Power Control Services**: Added remote power management commands
  - Graceful shutdown with auto-restart, load control, reboot, emergency kill
  - Safety validation and comprehensive logging

## [2.0.2] - 2025-01-07

### Enhanced Configuration UI
- **Improved User Experience**: Clear visual indicators for required vs optional fields
- **Better Field Organization**: Logical grouping with helpful descriptions and examples
- **Enhanced Translations**: Comprehensive help text for each configuration option
- **Refined Defaults**: Optimized battery level (10%) and timeout (5 minutes) settings

## [2.0.0] - 2025-06-06

### Modernized and Integrated
- **SECURITY**: Complete security overhaul with comprehensive input validation
- **SECURITY**: Sanitized all configuration value injections to prevent command injection
- **SECURITY**: Added validation for UPS names, cable types, device paths, and configuration keys
- **SECURITY**: Limited extra configuration options to 50 items with size constraints
- **SECURITY**: File size limits for scripts (64KB) and config files (4KB email config, 1KB aliases)
- **SECURITY**: Proper file permissions and access controls

### Updated
